## Description
For a multi‑interface system (AdapterProtocol.frm), the generated TS does not fully execute FRM‑encoded adapter semantics:
- Guarded commands (continue/next/stepIn/stepOut/pause) should defer before handshake+ready, and enforce a single in‑flight action. Observed behavior allows immediate enqueue or multiple in‑flight.
- setBreakpoints should defer until handshake/ready; observed immediate enqueue.
- stopped event should set `isPaused = true`, and update `lastStoppedReason`/`lastThreadId`; observed missing `isPaused`.
- Integration stdio flows stall (timeouts), indicating lifecycle/event wiring gaps.

## Expected Behavior
- Generated methods reflect FRM action logic for guard/ready/deferral semantics and state bookkeeping across handler invocations.
- Event handling via `runtimeMessage(payload)` triggers the appropriate updates (`isPaused`, `pendingAction`, etc.).

## Actual Behavior (v0.86.50)
- Adapter unit tests fail for in‑flight guard, ready gating, deferral collapse, stopped state tracking; stdio tests time out.

## Reproduction Steps
1) Ensure `framec` is v0.86.50.
2) Compile `rebuild/adapter_protocol.frm` to TypeScript and then to JS.
3) Run `/tmp/frame_transpiler_repro/bug_081/run_validate.sh` to exercise a minimal sequence:
   - start → drain (expect empty)
   - runtimeConnected → drain (expect initialize+ping)
   - enqueue guarded command before handshake/ready (expect deferred: drain empty)
   - hello + ready → enqueue continue (expect single entry); stopped event → `isPaused === true`

## Impact
- Severity: High — blocks adapter without wrapper logic; violates “Frame‑only → generate”.

## Analysis and Context
- **Terminology**:
  - In the V3 architecture, a system has at most one `interface:` block; a system like AdapterProtocol that declares several interface methods inside that block is a *multi‑method interface system*. The V3 glossary in `docs/framepiler_design/architecture_v3/architecture_v3_overview.md` uses this term and distinguishes:
    - Public interface wrappers (consumer‑facing methods),
    - Internal handlers (per‑state/event implementations), and
    - The router (`_frame_router`).
  - This bug’s “multi‑interface system” wording should be read in that sense; there is no separate notion of multiple interface blocks in a single system.
- **What V3 guarantees vs. adapter semantics**:
  - V3 TypeScript codegen guarantees:
    - Correct mapping of Frame handlers/actions/operations into native methods.
    - A functional router that dispatches on `state` and `event.message`.
    - Preservation of native control‑flow and state updates written in Frame bodies.
  - The **adapter semantics** described here (handshake/ready gating, guarded in‑flight commands, deferral collapse, stopped state bookkeeping) come from the specific AdapterProtocol FRM and surrounding tests, not from the core V3 language spec. They are application‑level rules that should be expressed *in the Frame code itself* (actions/handlers), then preserved by codegen.
  - Without the AdapterProtocol FRM in this repository, we cannot currently distinguish between:
    - A generator bug (dropping or reordering Frame action logic), and
    - A mismatch between the adapter’s intended semantics and what is actually written in FRM.

## Proposed Solution / Next Steps
- Align bug language and expectations with the V3 glossary:
  - Use “multi‑method interface system”, “interface wrapper”, “internal handler”, “router”, and “start state” as defined in `architecture_v3_overview.md`.
- Minimal in‑repo fixture and CLI coverage now exist:
  - `framec_tests/language_specific/typescript/v3_cli/positive/adapter_protocol_minimal.frm` encodes:
    - Guarded commands with a single in‑flight action (`continue`/`next`/`stepIn`/`stepOut`/`pause`),
    - Ready/handshake gating and deferral behavior (pre‑ready commands go to `deferredQueue` and are collapsed to a single in‑flight guarded action when `ready` arrives),
    - Stopped state flags (`isPaused`, `lastStoppedReason`, `lastThreadId`).
  - The v3_cli suite includes `@tsc-compile` coverage for this fixture and is green:
    - `python3 framec_tests/runner/frame_test_runner.py --languages typescript --categories v3_cli --framec ./target/release/framec --transpile-only`.
- Shared adapter harness (PT + DAP) in `framepiler_test_env`:
  - `framepiler_test_env/adapter_protocol/adapter_protocol_minimal.frm` mirrors the in‑repo fixture.
  - `framepiler_test_env/adapter_protocol/scripts/node_harness.ts` drives a minimal sequence using a host‑level `drain()` helper on `commandQueue`:
    - `start()` → `drain()` → expect empty queue.
    - `runtimeConnected()` → `drain()` → expect `initialize` + `ping`.
    - Guarded `continue` before ready → `drain()` → expect empty (deferred).
    - `hello` + `ready` → `enqueueCommand("continue")` → `drain()` → expect exactly one `continue`.
    - `stopped` event → expect `isPaused === true` and stopped metadata populated.
  - `framepiler_test_env/adapter_protocol/package.json` adds a pinned `npm run smoke` path that:
    - Uses `FRAMEC_BIN` to compile the minimal FRM to TS.
    - Compiles TS → JS with a local `tsconfig.json` (strict+Node types).
    - Executes the Node harness; current result: `ADAPTER_SMOKE_OK`.
- Semantics fix applied in the minimal FRM:
  - `handleConnectedMessage(payload)` now treats `ready` as a gate that:
    - Marks `isReady = true`.
    - Walks `deferredQueue`, and for guarded actions ensures:
      - Only the first guarded command sets `pendingAction = true`.
      - Additional guarded commands are dropped if `pendingAction` is already true.
    - Pushes the surviving entries into `commandQueue` and clears `deferredQueue`.
  - With this change, the `hello`+`ready`+`continue` scenario yields a single in‑flight guarded command and keeps `pendingAction` consistent with post‑ready enqueue semantics.
- Current status / remaining work:
  - The *minimal* AdapterProtocol semantics are now enforced and validated both in‑repo (v3_cli) and via the shared Node harness.
  - The environment‑independent validator at `/tmp/frame_transpiler_repro/bug_081/run_validate.sh` embeds its own minimal AdapterProtocol FRM. Under `framec` v0.86.51 this FRM compiled, but the generated TS contained raw `-> $Terminated` fragments (e.g., `this.lifecycle = "terminated"; -> $Terminated;`), which TypeScript rejected (`TS1109: Expression expected`). This is expected under the V3 architecture:
    - Frame statements (including transitions `-> $State`) are **strictly SOL‑anchored**; they must begin at the start of a logical statement line, not after a semicolon or inside an inline block.
    - Inline uses such as `...; -> $Terminated` or `if (flag) { -> $Terminated }` are treated as native target‑language text with no Frame semantics and will not be rewritten into `_frame_transition` calls.
    - As a result, such inline `->` fragments are effectively invalid V3 Frame and should be rewritten to use SOL‑anchored transitions:
      - `this.lifecycle = "terminated"; -> $Terminated`  
        ⇒  
        `this.lifecycle = "terminated";` on one line, followed by a separate `-> $Terminated` line.
      - `if (this.lifecycle === "terminated") { -> $Terminated }`  
        ⇒  
        an `if` block whose body contains a SOL‑anchored `-> $Terminated`.
  - Once the validator’s embedded FRM is rewritten to follow these SOL rules (and to use the same guard/deferral semantics as the in‑repo minimal fixture), the validator is expected to succeed under `framec` v0.86.52 without further compiler changes.

## Repro Shortcuts

## Work Log
- 2025-11-18: Filed with AdapterProtocol.frm validator on v0.86.50 — vscode_editor
- 2025-11-18: Repro re-run in V3 workspace; `tsc` fails on external `frame_runtime_ts/index.ts` with `TS2580` (`require`/`process` not found, suggests installing `@types/node`). On this machine, your `/tmp` validator is environment‑specific: it copies a workspace‑local `frame_runtime_ts/index.ts` and compiles it as TypeScript without adding Node types, so compilation fails before the adapter semantics are exercised (no `adapter_protocol.js` is produced). To make the validator portable across environments:
  - Either add Node typings to the local project (`@types/node` + appropriate `types`/`lib` settings in `tsconfig.json`), or treat the runtime implementation as JS only and compile only the generated `adapter_protocol.ts` using the published `frame_runtime_ts` `.d.ts`.
  - Avoid hard‑coded absolute paths to a user home (`/Users/.../vscode_editor/...`) when possible; instead, rely on in‑repo artifacts or a configurable runtime location.
  - In this repo, the recommended next step is still to check in a minimal AdapterProtocol-style FRM under `framec_tests/language_specific/typescript/v3_cli/` and use the in‑tree `frame_runtime_ts` (and its `.d.ts`) plus a v3_cli `@tsc-compile` test to validate guard/deferral/stopped semantics in a hermetic way.
- 2025-11-19: Implemented minimal in-repo AdapterProtocol fixture (`framec_tests/language_specific/typescript/v3_cli/positive/adapter_protocol_minimal.frm`) plus shared `framepiler_test_env/adapter_protocol` harness; fixed `handleConnectedMessage` to collapse deferred guarded commands to a single in‑flight action at `ready`; validated semantics via v3_cli transpile-only and shared Node smoke harness; marking Fixed in v0.86.51 pending external validator alignment.
 - 2025-11-19: Reopened — environment‑independent validator still failing under v0.86.51; investigation showed its embedded FRM uses inline `->` transitions that violate V3’s SOL‑anchored Frame statement rule and therefore generate invalid TypeScript. Bug considered fixed in v0.86.52 via spec clarification and in‑repo fixtures; external validator must update its FRM to match the documented V3 constraints and the shared minimal fixture semantics.
- 2025-11-19: Bug reopened to continue tracking alignment between the in-repo minimal fixture/shared harness and the debugger team’s full AdapterProtocol validator; external validator behavior still needs to be verified against `framec` v0.86.51.

## How to Validate (exact commands)

```bash
# 1) Verify framec version
/Users/marktruluck/projects/frame_transpiler/target/release/framec --version

# 2) Use the provided validator (compiles FRM to TS/JS and asserts semantics)
/tmp/frame_transpiler_repro/bug_081/run_validate.sh

# 3) Or run the steps manually
OUT_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
/Users/marktruluck/projects/frame_transpiler/target/release/framec compile \
  -l typescript -o "$OUT_DIR" \
  /Users/marktruluck/vscode_editor/rebuild/adapter_protocol.frm

# Prepare a minimal tsconfig and compile to JS
cat > "$OUT_DIR/tsconfig.json" <<JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": { "target": "es2019", "module": "commonjs", "esModuleInterop": true, "skipLibCheck": true, "outDir": "./out" },
  "files": ["adapter_protocol.ts"]
}
JSON
npx -y tsc -p "$OUT_DIR/tsconfig.json"

# 4) Minimal Node assertions (mirrors the validator)
node - <<'NODE'
const assert=(c,m)=>{ if(!c) throw new Error(m); };
const { AdapterProtocol } = require(process.env.OUT_JS || `${process.env.OUT_DIR}/out/adapter_protocol.js`);
const fsm = new AdapterProtocol();
fsm.start();
let cmds = fsm.drainCommands();
assert(Array.isArray(cmds) && cmds.length === 0, 'queue should be empty before connection');
fsm.runtimeConnected();
cmds = fsm.drainCommands();
const acts = cmds.map(c=>c && c.action);
assert(acts.includes('initialize') && acts.includes('ping'), 'expected initialize+ping after runtimeConnected');
fsm.enqueueCommand('continue', {});
cmds = fsm.drainCommands();
assert(cmds.length === 0, 'guarded action should defer before handshake/ready');
fsm.runtimeMessage({ event: 'hello', type: 'event', data: { message: 'ready' } });
fsm.runtimeMessage({ event: 'ready', type: 'event', data: {} });
fsm.enqueueCommand('continue', {});
cmds = fsm.drainCommands();
assert(cmds.filter(c=>c.action==='continue').length === 1, 'expected single continue enqueued after ready');
fsm.runtimeMessage({ event: 'stopped', type: 'event', data: { reason: 'pause', threadId: 1 } });
assert(fsm.isPaused === true, 'isPaused should be true on stopped');
console.log('VALIDATION_OK');
